                  <h3>How it works?</h3>
                  <p>We purchased Django Girls goodies in bulk quantity, which 
                    massively lowered their price. It will save everyone time and
                      money and you will be able to focus on more awesome things.
                    The box can be sent to Django Girls workshops from all over the world:
                      small goodies and swag won't drain your sponsor money anymore! YAY! âœ¨ðŸ’°</p>

                    <p>We calculated that one event of 30 people would need to pay
                        around Â£150 GBP for all of those things, and sometimes
                        they're hard to get. We're able to buy and ship them all for around $50.
